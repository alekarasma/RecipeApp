Android Based Recipe App built with Jetpack Compose, following Clean Architecture with MVI (Model-View-Intent). 
The app reads recipes from a JSON file, loads images dynamically using Coil, and ensures seamless navigation with Jetpack Compose Navigation.
It leverages Kotlin Coroutines and Flow for efficient asynchronous data handling and Koin for lightweight dependency injection.
