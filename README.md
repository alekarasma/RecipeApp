Android Based Recipe App built with Jetpack Compose, following Clean Architecture with MVI (Model-View-Intent). 
The app reads recipes from a JSON file, loads images dynamically using Coil, and ensures seamless navigation with Jetpack Compose Navigation.
It leverages Kotlin Coroutines and Flow for efficient asynchronous data handling and Koin for lightweight dependency injection.

**Features**
Jetpack Compose UI – Fully declarative and modern UI.
Jetpack Compose Navigation – Seamless navigation between screens.
Clean Architecture with MVI – Separation of concerns for better scalability.
Koin Dependency Injection – Lightweight and modular DI setup.
Kotlin Coroutines & Flow – Efficient asynchronous data handling.
JSON Data Handling – Reads and parses structured recipe data.
Coil Image Loading – Fast and efficient image loading from URLs.
Dark Mode Support – Adaptive UI based on system settings.
